Added google analytics onto the webpage so that we can collect data to optimize the website.
Added restrictions to html and body so that there is no excess scrollbar in mobile view:
    - Added styles that would change the html and body tags so that overflow within the
    x-axis was hidden.
Added old leaves back, resized to reduce lag:
    - Changes were made in index.html regarding the set divs for the images.
Changed the sizes for background words "Inspire" and "Change":
    - Made it so that as the user minimized the webpage the font-size would
    adjust according.
    - Added the color-title-background to the @media section with max-width: 991px
    within the CSS files elle-hacks-10.css and elle-hacks.css.

Nothing major, I just learned about forking and such for github and so I took
the work that I did and reuploaded it.
Removed two leaf images:
    - This means six leaf objects were removed.
    - They were removed because leafSize forcefully altered it's size
    causing animation lag issues at the start.
    - We can either readd them later but downscale them or find new ones instead.

Updates As Of 2019-11-27:
Updated by: Leo Tran
Completely changed the colors of the website from blue to orange.
Added in animation.css which includes:
    - Animation effects for leaves and buttons.
    - Animation effects "should" be supported on all browsers, there are three variations.
    - UnselectableImage class which makes it so applied objects aren't highlighted.
Added leaf animation within the hero-container section:
    - Three different set of images creating a laying effect of leaves falling.
Added button bounce animations for the social media and email buttons at footer section:
    - Attached class onto each object, more information is within the animation.css file.
Adjusted the image section for hackers, volunteers, and mentors:
    - Changed ratios of images
    - Added new class(w-col-13) within components.css for new ratios
Changed colors for background words "Inspire" and "Change":
    - Adjusted colors within elle-hacks.css and elle-hacks-10.css (unsure of the difference between each file as it was created by the previous developer).
